Specifically, he has developed an economic decision tool for producers to make informed decisions about the costs and benefits of using grafting production system in their vegetable farms. In addition, he works in a multi-disciplinary team to identify and quantify the impact of on-farm grafting technology adoption on producers and the environment.\r[Download my CV]\n","date":1590019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1590019200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://yfnian.github.io/author/yefan-nian/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/yefan-nian/","section":"authors","summary":"Yefan Nian is a PhD students in Food and Resource Economics at the University of Florida.

Governance quality of local irrigation systems and the norm of cooperation have strong predictive powers of farmers’ decisions to contribute. Strongly agree other villagers can be trusted is positively correlated with farmers’ decisions to contribute cash instead of the labor and the share of total cash investment at the village level contributed by farmers.
